    "- one person **must** look at [keras tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) \n",

    "As a group, make sure that you can adapt the workbook to take datasets from the local store /home/common/datasets/cifar (csctcloud) or /shared/datasets/cifsr (jupyter.csctcloud) where possible to save on bandwidth and storing multiple copies of the same data. \n",
