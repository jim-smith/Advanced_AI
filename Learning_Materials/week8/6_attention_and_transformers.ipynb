    "# Practical 6: Attention and Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Seq2seq model is limited by fixed size input and output vectors. For many tasks, such as Machine Translation (MT), text summarisation and generating text with a language model, we may wish to output different size sequences. The performance of Seq2seq models may also be limited by the single fixed-size context vector produced by the encoder, which reduces the amount of information passed to the decoder. The attention mechanism aims to solve these issues. Instead of encoding a single context vector the encoder produces a *sequence* of vectors, one for each timestep of the input. The attention mechanism then allows the decoder to 'pay attention' to the important important inputs and ignore less important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although attention mechanisms often result in a significant performance boost on many task, the recurrent nature of Seq2seq architecture means it is slow to train. To overcome this issue Vaswani, A. et al. (2017) proposed a new architecture, the Transformer, which throws away recurrence and focuses only on attention. [Attention is all you need!](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf). Transformers have since become the basis for nearly all state-of-the-art models for language modelling, classification, MT, summarisation and many other NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this practical we will create a Seq2seq model with attention for MT. The MT model will be trained to translate English sentences into French with an [English to French](http://www.manythings.org/anki/) dataset. Once trained, we will be able to translate English phrases and visualise the weights of the attention mechanism to understand which English words were 'attended to' in order to produce the translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this practical we will create a Transformer-based translator by fine-tuning an existing model, the [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683v3), on our translation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this practical are:\n",
    "1. Understand how Seq2seq architecture and attention mechanisms work, and help the model to identify the important features of input sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduce a new ML library, Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers that is usefull for building and fine-tuning large Transformer models\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare and contrast recurrent Seq2seq with attention to a transfer learning approach using a large pre-trained language model (T5), based on Transformer architecture, for MT"

    "\n",
    "**Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)**, is a score for comparing a candidate translation of text to one or more reference translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BLEU score is more precision based than recalled. In other words, it is based on evaluating whether all words in the generated candidate are in the reference that a manual evaluator comes up with. But it does not check if all words in reference are covered!\n",
    "\n",
    "- BLEU score does not take into account semantic similarity. The BLEU score looks for exact word matches. But it does not consider the fact that a word such as red is close to the word scarlet for instance. For example, “the cat is on the mat” should be semantically similar to “the cat is over the mat”. However, “the cat is under the mat” does not mean hte same thing! BLEU score fails here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good matches often have clusters of words in candidate that match closely with clusters of words in the reference. BLEU score is not great with capturing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**METEOR** evaluates a translation by computing a score based on explicit word-to-word matches between the translation and a given reference translation. If more than one reference translation is available, the translation is scored against each reference independently, and the best scoring pair is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is trained we can evaluate it by calculating the BLEU and METEOR scores. First we should load the weights of the best model found during training. Then create a list of reference (ground truth) and candidate (predicted) sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loop over each batch in the test data (we will use the validation set)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the model to generate predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Convert the predicted token ids back into words, and similarly for the actual translation\n",
